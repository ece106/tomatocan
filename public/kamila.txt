  ========  Week 02/11/2019  ========
  Goals:
    -Complete ruby tutorial
    -Learn existing rsvpqs test cases
    -learn to write a test
    -test rsvpqs controllers
    -Fix controller tests for rsvpqs
    -Determine unused fields in DB
  
  Tuesday (4 hrs)
    -Deleted two unneeded test cases
    -Updated "should create rsvpq" event id to correctly refer to the event id (not a string)
    -Test still fails, waiting for events count to work correctly
    - "DEPRECATION WARNING: Dangerous query method (method whose arguments are used as raw SQL) called with non-attribute argument(s): "deadline IS NULL, deadline ASC". Non-attribute arguments will be disallowed in Rails 6.0. This method should not be called with user-provided values, such as request parameters or model attributes. Known-safe values can be passed by wrapping them in Arel.sql(). (called from set_user at /home/kamila/tomatocan/tomatocan/app/controllers/users_controller.rb:230)
    -Should anything be done about this
    -for rsvpqs, the controller file has updating. 
    -Should there be testing for updating rsvpqs
    Personal notes to look at:
      -rsvp redirecting back to event page or home page?
      -invalid email address message?
      -"home_path"?
