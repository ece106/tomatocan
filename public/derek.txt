Scrum Performance Summary - Derek Loche

===========================================
Priorites (Feel free to add and subtract items)

1. Research how to pass ruby variables into js  
  - Why: Usage maybe necessary in the future. Should be used to improve the Jitsi RoomName var.

2. Hide/Display the Jitsi Meet embed on the show page.   
  - Specifically: The page owner/user should be the only one able to toggle the meeting.

3. Moderator/Panel/Crowd Views  
  - Moderator Abilities
    1. Video and Audio chat
    2. Panel Participant Promotion/Demotion
    3. Boot Crowd and Chat Participants
    4. Full Chat:  Chat should appear and act like YouTube's chat so that it doesn't over lay the video stream
 
 - Panel Abilities
    1. Video and Audio chat
    2. Full Chat:  Chat should appear and act like YouTube's chat so that it doesn't over lay the video stream
  
  - Crowd Abilities
    1. Raising Hand: This should be toggled by the Moderator. This allows crowd participants to indicate they have something to say in order for the moderator to promote to a Panel member.
    2. Full Chat: Chat should appear and act like YouTube's chat so that it doesn't over lay the video stream

  - Fixed Jitsi Room Name integration
    - Currently uses a random number to generate a room; on usage. Currently an acceptable fix but permalink usage would be perferred
