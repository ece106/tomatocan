# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# Following Relationships
#users = User.all
#user = users.first
#following = users[2..50]
#followers = users[3..40]
#following.each {|followed| user.follow(followed)}
#followers.each {|follower| user.follower(user)}
