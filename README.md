CROWDPUBLISH.TV MENTORSHIP PROGRAM

Application Deadline: 
May 16, 2016

To Apply:

Stage 1. Submit the quiz posted in the readme at https://github.com/crowdpublishtv/crowdpublishtv.
Once an applicant's response to the quiz is received, mentoring will be available to that applicant for the second stage.

Stage 2. Go through the tutorial at https://github.com/crowdpublishtv/crowdpublishtv/blob/master/public/LearnRailsIn2Minutes.odt.
Write some tests for other than the User model and controller. Push the tests to the CrowdPublish.TV github repo.

Stage 3. Interview over Google Hangouts: After at least 3 tests have been pushed to the repo, you will be contacted to schedule an interview with Dr. Lisa Schaefer 

Criteria for candidate selection: 

- 1. Quality of responses to quiz questions
- 2. Quality & coverage of tests written for Stage 2
- 3. Self motivated / ability to meet deadlines without being reminded
- 4. Judgment skills / ability to figure out useful solutions related to the tutorial on your own
- 5. Interview demeanor/interest in project
- 6. Women will be given higher priority

The Mentoring Program:

The CrowdPublish.TV Ruby Mentoring Program is meant for people who have already gone through beginner Ruby learning materials, such as the Michael Hartl RailsTutorial. It is the 'next step' for gaining experience in working on a live app with a small team and a mentor. 

After candidates have been selected, we will start meeting online once a week for 1.5 to 2 hours to discuss the previous week's action items that were accomplished throughout the week. Candidates will have the opportunity for occasional one-on-one mentoring throughout the week also. 

The first 10 weeks of the program will focus on the CrowdPublish.TV test suite. Upon completion of the first 10 weeks, we will assess progress. Candidates will have input into the next steps and the future direction of the program. 

Possible direction after the first 10 weeks:
- Two or three new candiates are selected and some of the original 6 stay on to mentor the next group.
- Six new candidates are brought on and each get assigned to pair program with one of the original 6
- Continue for another 10 weeks, taking on increasingly difficult tasks without taking in new candidates
- Some combination of the above, or a different direction not thought of yet

Written job references:

Upon completion of the first 10 weeks, Dr. Schaefer would be willing to serve as a reference for candidates to potential employers. There are several things to consider when working toward a written reference regarding employment skills:
- 1. Skill level – Were you able to complete your agreed-upon tasks correctly
- 2. Diligence – Did you complete all the tasks you agreed to do in a timely manner
- 3. Commitment level – Did you take on meaningful tasks and continue with the program

For those who do not become one of the first 6:
Lurk in the hangouts. Even if you aren't part of the mentor program, you can work on similar tasks and push to the CrowdPublish.TV github repo for review. 

Work on the tutorial. Those who show skill, diligence, and commitment on the tutorial tasks will very likely be accepted to the mentor program in the next round.

The code will be used to provide free web sites for authors who own their rights to sell their merchandise, give livestreaming talks, and otherwise communicate with their existing and potential fans. Toward this end, developers may add whatever features they wish to the code. Think of this as becoming Ebay, Meetup, Livestream, book reviews, Facebook page, blog, crowdfunding, calendar, Mailchimp, & website for authors, reviewers/readers, book clubs, and writer organizations all in one.

Please check the Issues list on CrowdPublishTV's GitHub page for ideas of what current priorities are. 

The intention of this repository is to be used as a project for developers of all skill levels to improve their skills by contributing code and by assisting junior developers with their code contributions. The founder, Lisa Schaefer, Ph.D., has taught a beginners Ruby on Rails course at George Mason University and encourages women entrepreneurs to be the primary mentors, mentees, and leaders in this project. Dr. Schaefer also advocates for women's voices to be heard and heeded in the software development community.

CrowdPublish.TV is an experiment in using a live project to teach Ruby on Rails. During her 12 years of university education, Dr. Schaefer felt that academic exercises were a poor use of time compared to projects that would be used for real world business applications. She was disappointed that coursework did not result in knowledge of how the skills would be used in a real project. Internships did not bridge that gap, rather interns were required to learn a completely different set of skills at each new workplace. Dr. Schaefer wanted to propose courses in which the students' work would be used in a real life practical business application. The students who demonstrate improvement in skills while working on CrowdPublish.TV would have the opportunity to be promoted to mentors (much like students become Teaching Assistants in graduate school). Mentors who demonstrate mastery of skills would graduate to more supervisory roles.

The compensation to developers who participate in CrowdPublish.TV coding is free mentorship - no need to pay for code schools. Those who participate fully and consistently will receive recommendations to future employers. 

As CrowdPublish.TV grows to the point where a stable crew of developers can be supported, there will be a discussion among senior contributors on how senior developers would have opportunities for compensation for their work. The intention is to develop a new business model outside of the way current startup businesses are funded. Venture capital firms give high preference to male-owned and male-developed startups. They justify this discrimination by calling it "pattern matching," meaning that they fund people who look like other people they have previously funded. Instead of trying to break into the boys' game, women must create their own game, outside the male-created system, where women retain ownership of their inventions and do not rely on entities that do not value their worth. I believe that this model will benefit many men who are also not interested in the current system of startup funding and business practices.

### QUIZ FOR POTENTIAL DEVELOPERS
To determine current skill level -
Send your responses to info@CrowdPublish.TV & we'll respond with instructions on how to join our Monday evening Google hangouts & improve your Ruby on Rails & TDD skills along with us.

Note: Potential mentees with the highest skill level will be matched with mentors who have the highest skill level. Which means that potential mentors with the best skill set will get the more advanced mentees. Thus it is in your best interest to show off your current skills so you can work with others who are best positioned to challenge you. Refer to http://github.com/crowdpublishtv/crowdpublishtv and use tutorials, Google, etc. to help you figure out the answers. 

1. What is the design of the CrowdPublish.TV database? Submit as a jpg or png (You may draw on paper & submit as a photo).

2. Which file/view is the users' home page? What information do authors get to display on their home page? Where is this information stored in the CrowdPublish.TV database?

3. What pages/views do authors get in their web site when they sign up for CrowdPublish.TV?

4. What are the default views for all Rails apps?

5. What are the routes that were added to the CrowdPublish.TV app so the non-default/extra views for user pages could be displayed?

6. What are the methods that were added to the CrowdPublish.TV app so the non-default/extra user views/pages could be displayed? What file are they in?

7. Where is the method to add_bank_account to users? What gem does it use?

8. Fork a copy of the crowdpublishtv github repo (url above) into your GitHub account. Make a minor change that does not affect functionality (such as add a dummy file to the root directory) and request that the CrowdPublishTV admin pull your changes.

9. Summarize your Ruby & Rails skill level/what you know in your own words.


### TO USE THE CODE IN YOUR LOCAL TEST ENVIRONMENT

Files To Check/Change/Create: 

* config/initializers/carrierwave.rb: 
Make sure
```      
      :aws_access_key_id      => 'AWS_KEY', 
      :aws_secret_access_key  => 'AWS_SECRET_KEY',
```
       is NOT commented out.

* gemfile: 
    Delete 'pg' and replace with 'sqlite3'

* app/views/layouts/application.html.erb: 
    Make sure
```
  <%#= tag :meta, :name => "stripe-key", :content => ENV['STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY'] %>
```
    is commented out and that
```
  <%= tag :meta, :name => "stripe-key", :content => STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY %>
```
    is NOT commented out.

The ENV variables may already be commented out, depending upon what the last developer pushed. ENV variables are for Heroku. Therefore the last commit before pushing to Heroku must have those variables set. The non-ENV variables use the initializer files, which are for use on local machines. 

* config/initializers/fakekeys.rb: 
    Create this file DO NOT CHANGE THE NAME (note that it is listed in .gitignore) & paste the following into it:

```
DEVISE_SECRET_KEY = 'fake'
AWS_KEY = 'morefake'
AWS_SECRET_KEY = 'pretend' 
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = "madeup"
STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY = "allfake"
GMAIL_PWD = "superfake"
Stripe.api_key = STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
```

Of course, with the fake keys, you will not be able to use AWS (upload files to user profiles), Devise (logins), or Stripe (purchase items from authors). If you have your own AWS, Devise, or Stripe accounts, you may replace the keys in config/initializers/fakekeys.rb with your accounts' keys. 

*config/database.yml

Create this file DO NOT CHANGE THE NAME (note that it is listed in .gitignore) & paste the following into it:

```
default: &default
  adapter: sqlite3
  pool: 5
  timeout: 5000
```
```
development:
  <<: *default
  database: db/development.sqlite3
```
```
test:
  <<: *default
  database: db/test.sqlite3
```

Then type
```
>bundle install
```
at the command line to install all the necessary gems.

Then type
```
>rake db:migrate
```
at the command line to build the database with the correct schema.

Then type
```
>bin/rails server
```
at the command line to start the server.
