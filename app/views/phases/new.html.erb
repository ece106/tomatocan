  If you're just starting a new book/movie, your campaign goal could be focused on getting initial work done such as outlining, writing an intro, screenwriting, or casting. If you are in the middle of a book or movie project, the campaign goal should be about what you will be working on for the next month (next chapter, scene, etc). If you have completed projects but are not starting any new ones right now, think of this campaign as one of several post-completion phases that you perhaps have separate goals for such as publicity and speaking engagements.<br><br>
