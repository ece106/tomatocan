          - Support Women & Minorities in Tech: Mentor, Network, Improve Skills, Make a Difference <br>
          - Hang out in video chat with other people committing activism. We're currently working on open source tech related to building ThinQ.tv, a Woman Owned Tech Startup <br>
          - Peers and possibly mentors are there while you're working incase you have questions or need someone to bounce ideas, pair program, get feedback on your designs or activism plans <br>
          - No agenda. Drop in any time; we'll greet you when you arrive. 
          Feel free to work quietly in the chat room to be there for each other when that Aha moment happens
