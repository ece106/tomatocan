                      <p>No. Like the model of ebay or crowdfunding platforms, Conversation Hosts are responsible for making sure fans/customers receive what they ordered. Make sure you use these shipments to take advantage of the ability to send fans swag items they'd like to share with their friends, such as stickers, greeting cards, or other items that publicize your work. <br><br>

              CHECK DASHBOARD OFTEN to find out if fans purchased any Rewards that need to be fulfilled.
