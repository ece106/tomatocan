      <h3>ABOUT US</h3>
      <p>
        ThinQ.tv is a platform for live video thought-provoking conversations.
        Are you a good listener? <%= link_to 'Become an Online Mom or Dad', parents_path %> and post a Conversation time for high school & college students to drop in and be heard.
        <br>
        We're inviting churches, schools, parents' organizations, women's organizations, and any other interested groups to form a coalition to steer live video culture toward a harassment-free, civilized society where we can all grow our minds. <%= link_to 'Get involved!', getinvolved_path %>
        <br>
        Need to ask us questions LIVE? Drop in to any Your Online Mom session scheduled on the <%= link_to 'ThinQ.tv', "/" %> home page & meet our Founder, <br>Dr. Lisa Schaefer.

          <p>ThinQ.tv is like a Zoom meeting or Google Hangout, except that people can drop in to the Conversation from the home page schedule instead of having to be invited with a link. Please browse the current schedule and drop in to any of the Conversations posted. You may also post your own Conversation.</p>

              <p>Conversations - Conversations on all topics are permitted. We’re fostering a culture of intelligent thought, fellowship, and empathy. We encourage talking with people and listening - a Conversation, rather than the typical norm of internet video where one person talks at the internet.</p>
              <p>
              Donations - Conversation Hosts, such as churches, parents organizations, schools, women's organizations, etc., can receive donations in the sidebar during and after conversations. </p>
              <p>
              Sell your ebooks - Conversation hosts may sell downloads of their ebooks or other writings. You may also sell items that you would fulfill.</p>

          <p>
              Nothing! ThinQ.tv is free to sign up, host a live conversation, post donation buttons, post items to sell, schedule a show, and record the show to YouTube.<br><br>

              Conversation Hosts receive approximately 92% of each transaction they solicit in their sidebar on ThinQ.tv. ThinQ.tv doesn't get paid until you get paid. Our payment processor (Stripe) keeps $0.30 plus 2.9% of each transaction (the typical fee that payment processors charge). ThinQ.tv receives 5% of each transaction.
