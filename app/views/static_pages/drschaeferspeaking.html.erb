      <h3>Instead of the paradigm of an organization inviting people to listen to one person talk on social media, ThinQ.tv is for grassroots movements to motivate people through small group conversations. It’s similar to going to a cocktail party on Zoom. We're discussing about issues important in the 2020 election. Let's talk about how you can make the world a better place one conversation at a time!</h3><br>

      Everyone can participate in conversations about different social issues on ThinQ.tv. ThinQ.tv is for grassroots movements to motivate people through small group conversations. What topics are you passionate about? What are you already doing in your daily life to make the world a better place? Whom do you share your passions with?

    <div style="font-weight: bolder; color:#8C1D40; font-size: 20px;"> Empowering Women toward a Sexual Harassment-Free Culture
    </div>
      Society teaches that women's gender role is to be household servant. Women are punished if they question this role, which leaves them out of many positions of leadership. When women participate in society in public and online, they are insulted and demeaned. Just having the guts to continue showing your face is an act of activism. As a woman engineer, Dr. Lisa Schaefer was assaulted then fired, so instead of crawling back to another abusive employer, she founded ThinQ.tv. What has held you back from reaching for goals? We can work together to lead a culture where women's contributions are valued and women value themselves.
